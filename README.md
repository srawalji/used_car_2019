# used_car_2019
This was a final project I had for a Database Web Interface class in my master's program. The site made using HTML, CSS, PHP, and MySQL.

I made this in 2019, and Im trying to brush up on my HTML/CSS/PHP skills, so I will be uploading a "rennovation" so to speak following this upload. 
Let me know if you have any questions or comments!
